## About

Published machine learning engineer and evaluation researcher building clinically inspired diagnostics for frontier AI systems, applying biological and cognitive failure models to evaluation, red teaming, and agentic risk analysis. My decentralized intelligence model for R&D operates consortium style and extends from Southern California to international bodies from Paris to Singapore.

I am committed to forging responsible, ecocentric technology frameworks. Artist/engineer with a love of the classical arts and 20 years of service in hospitality, fine arts, production design, and entertainment. I studied political science at George Washington University and grew up in NYC with world-class mentors in the music industry and fine art sales.

Epically curious and a bonafide self-starter, currently contributing to domestic and international assurance standards in responsible tech. A skeptical techno-optimist currently researching quantum systems, evaluation design, adversarial ML, experimental mechanistic interpretability techniques, and cognitive-affective modeling alongside world-class institutions including but not limited to **NIST, CISA, UN ITU, Google, DeepMind, Anthropic, Humane Intelligence, Oxford, Amazon, and NVIDIA**.

## Current Roles

- **Founder & Director of Research**, ARTIFEX Labs — AI safety, interpretability, quantum systems, advanced computing
- **Technical Contributor & Working Group Co-Founder**, MLCommons — Agentic AI, Security, AI Risk & Reliability, AILuminate, MLPerf Automotive
- **Technical Red Teamer & Safety Researcher**, Humane Intelligence — Multimodal red teaming, policy-relevant audits
- **Quantum Futures Research Contributor**, Open Compute Project (Future Technologies Initiative)
- **Independent AI/ML Engineer**, Self-Employed Consultant — Mechanistic interpretability, adversarial ML, evaluation design

## Research Focus

**AI Safety and Benchmarking as a Service**
Socio-technical risk analysis across agentic, multimodal, and quantum-adjacent systems

**Evaluation Design Patterning, Clinical Diagnostics**
SCAI risk, epistemic coercion, dissociative reasoning; 'DSM for AI Systems'
[Sample Research: AI Psychosis Exploration](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGZQkMw4z8/2HwCBzMKxUXXbPhB0F3PZg/view)

**Hyperscaling and Multiagent Systems**
Agentic maturity, cascade failures, multi-agent reliability and safety

**Adversarial ML and Mechanistic Interpretability**
Jailbreaks, red teaming, neural tracing, exploit taxonomies, threat modeling

**Supply Chain Economics and Near Quantum Security**
Post-quantum cryptography and hardware-rooted security for quantum data centers
Quantum cryptography, error correction, hardware product design

**Artist and Musician IP Rights**
Algorithmic justice, content authenticity, and equitable compensation frameworks for creative work

**Post AGI Experimental Research and Development**
National defense, social network contagion, provenance, counterterrorism

## Technical Proficiency

Expert in rapidly adapting to new interfaces, languages, and libraries, with a fluid, dynamic learning style. Predominantly builds scripts and full-stack systems using proprietary agentic tools and AI copilots.

**Core Stack:**
Development & ML: Colab, Jupyter, PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, Hugging Face Transformers, TransformerLens, Inspect, Transluce Docent, Neuropedia
Cloud & Scaling: GCP (Cloud CLI, BigQuery, Vertex AI, Kubernetes), NVIDIA tools (OpenUSD, developer suite)
Prototyping & Coding: Visual Studio, GitHub, Replit, Lovable, v0, CodePen, Antigravity, Google AI Studio, Claude Code, OpenAI Codex
Agentic & Emerging: MCP servers/extensions, agentic SDKs (AgentDevelopmentKit), evaluation/benchmark design
Multimodal & APIs: Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, Mistral; quantum platforms (Qbraid, Qiskit, PennyLane, IonQ, Cirq)
Languages: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript (full-stack focus)
