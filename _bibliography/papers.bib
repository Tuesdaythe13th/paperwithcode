A system that meets reliability thresholds for a progressive sequence of principles for a specific task is considered to have climbed to a higher maturity level. This prototype maturity ladder was proposed by the MLCommons AI Risk and Reliability Working Group to inform agentic product adoption decisions and motivate reliability-focused innovation.},
