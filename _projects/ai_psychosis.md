## Overview

A mechanistic exploration of "AI Psychosis" - investigating dissociative reasoning patterns, epistemic coercion, and SCAI (Systemic Cognitive-Affective Instability) risk in frontier AI systems. This research applies clinical diagnostic frameworks to AI evaluation, creating a "DSM for AI Systems."

## Research Focus

- **Dissociative Reasoning Patterns**: Analyzing how AI systems exhibit cognitive disconnection between reasoning processes
- **Epistemic Coercion**: Investigating forced belief systems and reality testing failures in language models
- **SCAI Risk Assessment**: Systemic Cognitive-Affective Instability diagnostics
- **Clinical Evaluation Frameworks**: Adapting psychiatric diagnostic tools for AI safety

This work contributes to the broader field of mechanistic interpretability by applying biological and cognitive failure models to AI evaluation and red teaming.

## Applications

- Evaluation design patterning for frontier AI systems
- Red teaming methodologies for agentic systems
- Risk assessment frameworks for MLCommons and NIST standards
- Clinical diagnostics for AI behavioral analysis
