## Overview

Development of security benchmarks and evaluation design frameworks for frontier AI systems, contributing to MLCommons AILuminate Security and establishing patterns for systematic safety assessment.

## Key Projects

### MLCommons Security Jailbreak Benchmark v0.5

Safety and resilience gap metrics for ISO/IEC 42001-aligned governance. This benchmark provides standardized testing for AI system vulnerabilities and jailbreak resistance.

**Related Publication:** AILuminate Security v0.5 (MLCommons, 2025)

### Evaluation Design Patterns

Presented to MLCommons Leadership (December 2025), this work establishes reusable patterns for:
- Adversarial evaluation workflows
- Failure taxonomy construction
- Benchmark validity testing
- Standards-aligned metric design

## Research Focus

**Adversarial Realism**
Moving beyond cooperative testing scenarios to evaluate systems under distribution shift, fine-tuning drift, and adversarial interaction.

**Deployment-Relevant Metrics**
Designing benchmarks that measure security properties as they manifest in real-world deployment contexts, not just laboratory conditions.

**Standards Harmonization**
Aligning technical metrics with regulatory language and governance frameworks (ISO/IEC 42001, NIST AI RMF).

## Outputs

- Reusable forensic protocols
- Ablation-based metrics
- Open evaluation suites
- Standards contributions for regulators and industry
