## AccessibilityDeepAgent

An agentic AI framework designed to automatically detect accessibility issues and bias in AI systems, with a focus on inclusive design and algorithmic justice.

## Project Overview

Winner of the Humane Intelligence Bias Bounty Accessibility Challenge Set 4, this project demonstrates how agentic systems can be used to identify and remediate accessibility barriers in AI applications.

## Core Capabilities

**Automated Accessibility Testing**
- WCAG compliance checking
- Screen reader compatibility analysis
- Color contrast and visual accessibility
- Keyboard navigation testing

**Bias Detection**
- Multi-modal bias identification
- Intersectional analysis frameworks
- Accessibility-specific bias patterns
- Fair representation metrics

**Agentic Architecture**
- Autonomous testing workflows
- Self-improving detection algorithms
- Adaptive remediation suggestions
- Human-in-the-loop validation

## Recognition

- **Winner**: Humane Intelligence Bias Bounty Accessibility Challenge Set 4 (2025)
- Contributes to UNESCO Red Teaming Playbook on gender bias and harms

## Technical Implementation

Built using:
- Agentic SDKs and MCP servers
- Multi-modal evaluation frameworks
- TransformerLens for interpretability
- Custom accessibility testing harnesses
