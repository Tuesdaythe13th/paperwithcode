## The Mind Is Machine Readable

Research exploring cognitive-affective modeling, mental state representation, and the intersection of human psychology with AI interpretability.

## Research Questions

- How can we model human cognitive states in machine-readable formats?
- What are the implications of AI systems that can infer mental states?
- How do we create ethical frameworks for cognitive-affective AI?

## Key Themes

**Cognitive-Affective Modeling**
- Mental state representation
- Emotional intelligence in AI
- Theory of mind capabilities

**Ethical AI & Mental Health**
- Creative communities and mental health applications
- Patient care through AI-powered systems
- Privacy and consent in cognitive modeling

**Evaluation Frameworks**
- Presented at Stanford AIMI Symposium (Finalist)
- Integration with clinical AI evaluation standards
- Human-centered design principles
