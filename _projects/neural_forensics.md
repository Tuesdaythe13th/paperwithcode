## Neural Forensic Suite

A comprehensive toolkit for mechanistic interpretability research, focusing on neural tracing, exploit taxonomies, and threat modeling for frontier AI systems.

## Key Components

- **Neural Circuit Analysis**: Tools for tracing activation patterns through transformer architectures
- **Exploit Taxonomy Framework**: Systematic categorization of AI vulnerabilities and failure modes
- **Threat Modeling Tools**: Risk assessment for agentic and multimodal systems
- **Adversarial ML Testing**: Jailbreak detection and red teaming utilities

## Technical Stack

Built with PyTorch, TransformerLens, and custom interpretability frameworks. Integrates with:
- Hugging Face Transformers
- Transluce Docent
- Neuropedia
- Inspect evaluation framework

## Demo
