ARTIFEX Labs is announcing our 2026 research agenda: five interconnected pillars addressing the reality gap between AI safety research and deployment conditions.

## The Reality Gap

Most AI safety research assumes:
- Cooperative models
- Static weights
- Benign prompts
- Laboratory conditions

Real systems operate under:
- Distribution shift
- Fine-tuning drift
- Adversarial interaction
- Deployment pressure

**We study the gap between these worlds.**

## 2026 Research Pillars

### 1. Mechanistic Interpretability Under Deployment Conditions

**Problem:** Interpretability tools fail when needed most—under adversarial pressure and deceptive behavior.

**Agenda:**
- Causal assays for explanation faithfulness (behavior vs narration dissociation)
- Circuit-level diagnostics for agentic models
- Stress-testing interpretability tools against jailbreaks and deception
- Transferability of failure modes from closed to open-weight models

**Outputs:** Reusable forensic protocols, ablation-based metrics, open evaluation suites

### 2. Agentic AI Risk & Reliability

**Problem:** Agentic systems introduce planning depth, tool use, and long-horizon autonomy without corresponding advances in accountability.

**Agenda:**
- Failure taxonomies for multi-step agents
- Reward hacking and goal drift detection
- Agent memory, self-modeling, and deception risks
- Red-teaming-as-a-service methodologies for agents

**Outputs:** Agentic risk benchmarks, operational red team playbooks, governance guidance

### 3. Behavioral & Psychological Signal Leakage

**Problem:** AI systems increasingly infer mental states from interaction traces, often without user awareness or consent.

**Agenda:**
- Behavioral biometrics and cognitive state inference
- Defensive constructions against psychological profiling
- Auditing recommender and interaction systems for mental state extraction
- Standards-aligned risk thresholds for psychological harm

**Outputs:** Defensive tooling, audit frameworks, policy-relevant evidence

### 4. Socio-Affective Alignment & Human Impact

**Problem:** Alignment research underweights affect, trauma, addiction, and social context.

**Agenda:**
- Socio-affective failure modes (parasociality, dependency, manipulation)
- Session-level risk detection and mitigation
- Human-AI interaction safety protocols
- Alignment beyond preference learning

**Outputs:** Risk signal taxonomies, session safety protocols, design constraints

### 5. Standards, Benchmarks, and Public Infrastructure

**Problem:** Safety claims outpace verifiable standards.

**Agenda:**
- Contribution to open benchmarks for AI risk and reliability
- Alignment between technical metrics and regulatory language
- Transparency indexes and auditability criteria
- Cross-sector standards harmonization

**Outputs:** Benchmarks, whitepapers, standards contributions suitable for adoption by regulators and industry

Active contributions to MLCommons (AILuminate, Security Jailbreak Benchmark) and NIST AI RMF.

## Strategic Objectives

- Establish ARTIFEX Labs as a neutral forensic authority for AI failure analysis
- Produce at least two deployable safety tools or benchmarks
- Influence international standards through evidence-based contributions
- Bridge interpretability research with real-world governance needs

## Collaboration Model

ARTIFEX Labs operates as a decentralized, remote-first R&D network. We convene researchers through a consortium-style model emphasizing:

- **Epistemic parity** - Evidence over affiliation
- **Distributed accountability** - Auditable artifacts
- **Ethical reciprocity** - Respect for human subjects
- **Open provenance** - Public-benefit infrastructure

## Current Work in Progress

- **AI Psychosis Research** - Mechanistic exploration of dissociative reasoning
- **Security Benchmarks** - MLCommons evaluation design patterns
- **Mechanistic Interpretability** - MATS 2026 research dossier
- **Quantum Futures** - Quantum assurance standards (OCP FTI)

## Why Independence Matters

This agenda requires:
- Falsifiability over narrative coherence
- Evaluation against worst-case use
- Treating psychological impacts as first-class safety variables
- Research outputs that survive deployment

We maintain institutional independence to preserve epistemic integrity and avoid capture by misaligned incentives.

## Join Us

ARTIFEX Labs is seeking researchers, engineers, and domain specialists for Winter 2026 Cohort participation.

**Expression of Interest:** general@artifex.fun
**Subject Line:** "Expression of Interest — Winter 2026 Cohort"

Include 1-2 paragraphs describing a safety, security, or accountability problem you believe warrants forensic investigation.

**ARTIFEX Labs** treats AI safety as an engineering discipline grounded in reality, not aspiration. Our 2026 agenda is designed to surface uncomfortable truths, quantify hidden risks, and build tools that make advanced systems accountable to the humans they affect.
