## About

I am committed to forging responsible, ecocentric technology frameworks. Artist/engineer with a love of the classical arts and 20 years of service in hospitality, fine arts, production design, and entertainment. Studied political science at George Washington University and grew up in NYC with world-class mentors in the music industry and fine art sales.

Currently contributing to domestic and international assurance standards in responsible tech, researching quantum systems, evaluation design, adversarial ML, experimental mechanistic interpretability techniques, and cognitive-affective modeling alongside world-class institutions including **NIST, CISA, UN ITU, Google, DeepMind, Anthropic, Humane Intelligence, Oxford, Amazon, and NVIDIA**.

**Based in:** Portland, Los Angeles, and New York (remote-first)
**Open to:** Relocation (Especially London) and other on-site roles

## Current Roles
